Implement a console-based social networking application (similar to Twitter) with the features below.

### Features:

- [x] **User creating**: a new user called *Spike* can be created
- [x] **Posting**: *Spike* can publish messages to a personal timeline
- [ ] **Reading**: *Spike* can view *Nikesh’s* timeline
- [ ] **Following**: *Leo* can subscribe to *Spike* and *Nikesh's* timelines, and view an aggregated list of all subscriptions

To run
-----
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:kevinlanzon/twitter-java.git
```
Open and build your run in IntelliJ (I just broke everything trying to add Gradle to run the build!)
